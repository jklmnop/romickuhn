## City of Philadelphia and Accommodations

We are happy to welcome out of town family and friends to the City of Brotherly Love.  This is our home and we are excited to share it in all its grit and glory.  Philadelphia is a walkable city rich with arts and culture, incredible food, and can be quite lovely in the spring. 

There are several hotels in the area.  These are a few recommendations.

* [The Independent, 12th and Locust Streets](http://www.theindependenthotel.com)
* [The Alexander Inn, 12th and Spruce Streets](http://www.alexanderinn.com)
* [Rodeway Inn, 12th and Walnut Streets](https://www.choicehotels.com/pennsylvania/philadelphia/rodeway-inn-hotels/pa271)

*Please note that our wedding coincides with the NFL Draft in Philadelphia,  so hotel rooms are filling up rather quickly.*

We recommend using Airbnb, as it encompasses a range of prices and accommodation styles, and is available in a variety of neighborhoods.
